# PostageApp Example Node.js Application

This is a simple demonstration of how you can integrate [PostageApp](http://postageapp.com/)
wiht a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application. In this case it's built
on [Express](http://expressjs.com), but the same principles apply to any
application using Node.

## Installation

The dependencies can be installed with either `npm` or `yarn`:

    npm install

From there it should be as simple as:

    npm start

The application itself is accessible through [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
unless the port has been reconfigured.
